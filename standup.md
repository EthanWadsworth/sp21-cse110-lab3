# Team <team_name> Daily Standup Meeting

**Date:**

**Estimated Standup Meeting Duration:**

The frequency of standup meetings should be decided beforehand. This template is for a a single standup meeting. A table for a weekly tracker is provided at the bottom.

Each team member will have a bullet addressing the following questions, with their name:

**What did you work on yesterday?**
- Ethan: Updated the form UI on our signup page and established connection to backend on form submit.

**What will you be working on today?**
- Ethan: Writing tests to examine product functionality and versatility.

**Are there any issues that are currently blocking your progress?**
- Ethan: Waiting on user authentication code to test user signup and login.

It might be useful to instead put it into a table format, depending on the team. This makes it easier to see progress made overall during the week and keep everyone involved as they see the progress being made:
