                    It's the start of week 2, and it almost feels like I'm already swamped in work. While the 
                    work so far has not been too bad and I really enjoy my classes, I'm very apprehensive about
                    what will happen once they all start to ramp up at once. After attending my classes, and 
                    grinding out some more of my homework for the week, I got to watch the NCAA Championship game
                    with my roommates. I was very happy to see Baylor win over Gonzaga because they knocked USC
                    out of the tournament! I spent the rest of the night after meeting with my homework group 
                    for CSE 101 playing some League with my roommates and friends, and got my first pentakill :D.
                    I think Mondays will be more of a free day for me, where I get to choose what I need to work on
                    or what I want to do.
                    <br><br>
                    The speakers I got for my monitor also arrived a couple of days ago, and I finally got around to
                    setting them up. Here's a picture. I finally have a somewhat complete setup, whoo!

                        Even though I have to wake up a little earlier this quarter on Tuesdays, I planned out 
                        my schedule so I don't have have many classes on certain days of the week like today. 
                        Because my day is lighter, I can actually go and do stuff outside of school that I want to do.
                        I've been trying to get more exercise in after essentially stopping completely since the pandemic
                        started. I swam competitively for 7 years, so not getting any exercise has made me kind of restless 
                        during the day. I actually went on my first run in a long time around the Warren college area, 
                        and I hope I can get into a bit of a routine as the quarter goes on.

                    I spent the rest of the night working on testing our aimbot software for Triton Robotics and gettin it up
                    and running. Here's a video I <strong>tried</strong> to put together of a video demonstration of the target 
                    detection and tracking, but I do not understand how to properly video edit anything, so 
                    I ended up with a very janky-looking video. Here's how it came out:

                    Despite thinking that my day would end up not being that busy, I still
                    ended up going to sleep at around 3 am T_T.

                <p>
                    Just another <b>very, very, very</b> busy day for me today. I'm writing this 
                    entry at the end of the day, and many am I exhausted. Despite being very busy every 
                    Wednesday this quarter, I don't actually hate my Wednesdays (yet). I really enjoy all the 
                    lectures that I have for the day, and have really been ejoying the lab activities in 110 
                    as well.
                    <br><br>
                    I actually had my first tutor lab hours for the quarter today as a tutor for CSE 30. I 
                    always look forward ot talking to other students and helping them figure out any conceptual
                    or programming issues they might be having. Even though I only got to talk to 2 students 
                    today, I got to have really interesting conversations with each of them. One of them was 
                    very interested in tutoring here for the university, so I talked to him about my experiences 
                    as a tutor and what he could try to do to improve his application and also become a tutor. 
                    <br><br>
                    One of the songs that I recently found that I have really been enjoying and helps me get 
                    through long work days like this is <i>Look at the Sky</i> by Porter Robinson. 
                    The music video for the song can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJBh_hj6DzE">here</a>.
                    The vibe of the song and its energy give me the motivation to keep pushing through what I need to do.
